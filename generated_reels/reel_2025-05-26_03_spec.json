His expensive dress shoes are polished, but his generic black sock on one foot is noticeably crumpled and sliding down around his ankle, creating an uncomfortable bunched-up look. His foot is subtly, but desperately, wiggling and trying to readjust the sock inside his shoe, causing his shoe to 'dance' almost imperceptibly."

A BOARD MEMBER (50s, female) across the table subtly tilts her head, a hint of confusion and concern on her face, noticing Mark\u2019s bizarre distraction. Mark briefly loses his train of thought, stammering."
