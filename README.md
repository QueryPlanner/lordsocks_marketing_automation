# LordSocks Reel Automation

Ignore `main.py` for now.
Focus on `make_reels.ipynb`.

## To Do:

*   Make robust code to generate two videos randomly for 4 available styles.
*   Generate caption with AI.
*   Think about music generation and experiment with background speech.
*   Use GCS buckets for uploads.
*   Once that is done, then main it as a backend or a `main.py` file.
