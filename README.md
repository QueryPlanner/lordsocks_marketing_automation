# LordSocks Reel Automation

Ignore `main.py` for now.
Focus on `make_reels.ipynb`.

## To Do:

*   Improvise on prompt engineering
*   Think about music generation and experiment with background speech.
*   Also make funny templates that can use existing generated videos.
*   Once that is done, then main it as a backend or a `main.py` file.
