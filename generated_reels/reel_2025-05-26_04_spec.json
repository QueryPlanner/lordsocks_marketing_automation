The feet are held precariously over a single, tiny, sputtering birthday candle flame, which looks comically ineffective. A faint, 'cold' steam rises from the feet, emphasizing extreme chill."

He holds his feet awkwardly over the pitiful candle, his expression a theatrical mix of profound misery and desperate, futile hope. His breath is visibly condensing in the cold air."

Bertram's feet are now clad in plush, vibrant LordSocks (one cream, one forest_green, showcasing the rich colors and soft wool blend). The feet are elevated on a luxurious, velvet cushion. Bertram's toes wiggle slowly and exquisitely, as if experiencing pure bliss. A soft, warm, almost ethereal light emanates from his feet, signifying ultimate warmth."

He's now comically wearing only a luxurious silk robe and a laurel wreath, despite the implied continued 'winter' outside. The room is brightly lit, undeniably cozy, with a roaring fireplace in the background. His hand lazily gestures a 'dismissal' of all past suffering. Other LordSocks colors (burgundy, charcoal) are neatly folded on a side table nearby, looking incredibly inviting."
