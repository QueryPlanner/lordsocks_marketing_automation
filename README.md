# LordSocks Reel Automation: From 100 Socks to Viral Success ðŸ§¦

## My Story
Started with 100 pairs of uniquely printed socks and a dream. Using this reel automation system, we transformed our inventory into viral Instagram content that resonated with sock enthusiasts worldwide. Check out our success story at [@lordsocks.official](https://www.instagram.com/lordsocks.official/)!

> ðŸ”¥ **Limited Stock Alert**: Only a few pairs of our most popular designs remain available! Don't miss out on these conversation starters for your feet.

## The Magic Behind the Scenes
The heart of our viral content machine lies in `make_reels.ipynb` - a self-contained notebook that handles everything from content creation to posting. With just:
- Instagram Graph API credentials
- Google Cloud Storage (or similar object storage)
- Your creative sock inventory

You can automate your way to engaging reel content that converts views into sales.

## How It Works
The notebook seamlessly:
1. Generates creative reel concepts
2. Produces engaging video content
3. Handles music and effects
4. Directly uploads to Instagram

No need to worry about `main.py` yet - the notebook has everything you need to get started on your sock empire journey!
