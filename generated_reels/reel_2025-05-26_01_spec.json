      "description": "Opens on a brightly lit, minimalist living space with a polished concrete floor. A quirky, energetic person (20s-30s, dressed casually) attempts an elaborate 'comfort dance' \u2013 a mix of balletic spins and jazz hands \u2013 but their bare feet (or thin, worn socks) are clearly suffering. Their movements become increasingly pained and exaggeratedly awkward: wincing, hobbling on tiptoes, doing comical 'air steps' to avoid landing. They occasionally hop on one foot, massaging the other, with a dramatically pained expression. The scene culminates with them collapsing onto a strategically placed, very soft beanbag chair, holding their feet dramatically, looking utterly defeated.",

      "title": "Cloud-Like Transformation",
      "description": "Continues from Scene 1. The defeated person is still slumped on the beanbag. A pair of pristine white Blue Dragon crew socks (with clear branding visible near the cuff and a noticeable plushness) are almost magically presented, perhaps floating into frame or dramatically pulled out from a nearby cushion. A close-up shows the person's expression shift from despair to hopeful intrigue as they grasp the socks. They quickly pull them on, with a satisfying 'whoosh' sound effect. As the second sock settles, their entire demeanor transforms. Their face lights up with pure bliss. They spring up from the beanbag with impossible lightness, immediately resuming their 'comfort dance' from Scene 1, but this time, they are graceful, floating, and gliding effortlessly across the hard floor. They might even execute a comical, smooth moonwalk or an exaggeratedly soft tap-dance, ending with a final shot of their feet, perfectly cushioned in the white Blue Dragon socks, looking incredibly comfortable and bouncy.",

        "A gentle, satisfying 'plush' sound effect with each soft landing of their feet.",
        "A final, resonant sound of comfort (e.g., a soft chime or hum)."
